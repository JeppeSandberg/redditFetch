kj8p2af,"&gt; Wards that would be placed beside a brush are now slightly nudged into them.  Huge change"
kj8ib6l,"&gt;  Updating Practice Tool to work with some of the new features introduced in 14.1 alongside a few additional changes:   Button added to spawn Voidgrubs and Jungle Monsters  Button added to create a Spell Shield on your Target  Button added to copy your Inventory to your Target  Button added to cycle between various CC Effects on your champion  Reset Game now sets the game times to 0:00 in order to help with timing jungle clears  Fixed a bug that caused Reset Game to use the incorrect icon  ---  Thank you riot!"
kj8mz90,"&gt;We’ve previously adjusted this with First Strike previously and are now doing the same for Aery now.  Whoever wrote this was on their 28th coffee lmao."
kj8hzx8,"&gt;  We’ve seen double support items start to surface as a game warping strategy  so we’re adjusting the gold income rules on all of the support items which should effectively eliminate the viability of doubling up on support items and the gold they give.  new  &gt;One At A Time: The gold penalty now applies globally to anyone who has a support item in their inventory. Additionally  every champion with a support item now contributes towards hitting the minion penalty."
kj8lxgx,"&gt;Taric E now ghosts units during the cast.  Dang this has gotta be *HUGE*  &gt;Fixed a bug that caused Jhin’s 4th shot  when fired within a few frames of his out of combat reload  to sometimes fail.  FINALLY!!!! WOO!!!!"
kj8unrp,"Rumble Q damage increased  god bless it's only a typo. Bro I almost fainted."
kj8jehp,"&gt;\- Trundle Q has 25 bonus range.   &gt;   &gt;\- Volibear Q has 25 bonus range.  Huge buffs for these two."
kj8pckb,"AD Tf buffs seem absolutely massive!"
kj8m3fo,"Love that quality of life for ornns ult. I've done that a few times and it does not feel good. Like why would I ever want to use the mini map or ally characters to use my R2 dash."
kj8i63e,"incoming one week of posts "WHERE IS SMOLDER" for people who can't read"
kj8qogf,"Kog’Maw gains an AA range indicator during his W (like Lethal Tempo/RFC) - that is fucking huge buff damn"
kj8ngu0,"That Red Kayn/Rhaast adjustment is huge."
kj8tnex,"Is splitpushing going to be a problem with some of these changes adding extra tower damage? Jax W and R doing 50% damage to towers now sounds like he will melt them."
kj8n33c,""Sorry guys Smolder cancelled we fired the guy that made him (partially). Lol.""
kj8rezj,"When do the new AI bots get here"
kj8r28n,"&gt;R - Noxious Trap      &gt;   &gt; Charge Charge Time: 30025/20 seconds ⇒ 35/30/25 seconds  &amp;#x200B;  Huge Buff to the Charge time loosing 29990 second on level 1 /s   (and yes  i know its a typo but it gave me a chuckle nontheless)"
kj9aebh,"&gt; Taric E now ghosts units during the cast.  This is under "gameplay quality improvements" but this is the largest buff Taric has ever recieved"
kj8ran3,"&gt;Rhaast’s R now heals even if the unit dies during the channel.  Holy shit they finally did it!"
kj8p59z,"Can Shaco clone also fake a W box?"
kj8l4rk,"They finally adjusted Lighting Round challenge !!!! Was impossible to win before 10mn with the new portals and the shorter death timers."
kj8lhrv,"Stridebreaker buffs with Garen and Darius buffs  oh boy I can't wait."
kj8rk6x,"&gt; Jayce Hammer E now uses regular knockback instead of fixed distance upon the spell being cast.  In this current patch  Jayce E knocks unit further back if they are closer to you. This is either a huge buff or nerf."
kj8w4u2,"Q - Inner Flame  Damage: 70/120/170/220/270 (+50% AP) ⇒ 70/120/170/220/270 (+70% AP)   I'm trying AP Karma mid with Malignance next patch I guess"
kj8xww3,"this is honestly a crazy patch if you take the time to read all the champion changes + the bug fixes. so crazy. my personal least fave is   “Fixed a bug that sometimes caused Neeko to get stuck running on all fours for the duration of the game”  because i saw this and loved it"
kja4wnq,"&gt; Fixed a bug that caused players to be able to flash out of grounded zones they had teleported onto if they were **spamming the flash key  F**.  Flash is on F  it's now officially Riot's recommendation. Dlashers in shambles."
kj8qpe0,"I'm so glad they are hitting the scaling portion of Stormsurge. The item itself feels like a Mage item but how hard it scales has been ridiculous. Instead of feeling like it added an item to your kit it almost feels like it gives you an entire capstone Rune."
kj8ps46,"&gt;Vanguard  &gt;we will run a diagnostics check to see if your computer is ready for this update.  What does that mean?"
kj8ttoc,"No one can stop me going ADC TF now! First timing him in the next Clash"
kj8rj6m,"why is trundle getting a fucking buff????"
kj8it06,"God that Hexplate build change is going to feel ass  I guess it makes the build paths neat like they said but it would be nice if Hearthbound wasn't such a shit epic  &gt; Ability Haste per Infernal Cinder: 0.3 ⇒ 0.6  at least its something but they still feel like just speed boosts and nothing more  collecting them feels irrelevant  A lot of QoL changes  that's nice to see  Wish they would remove Hubris from ARAM  feels like its effectiveness is far greater there than it should be  Ezreal time :)"
kj8p1oc,"That Brand buff tho"
kj8o99h,"Did they not fix the music bug? Sometimes two music tracks are playing at the same time  and it never fixes itself throughout the game no matter where I move on the map."
kj8jwj5,"&gt; ARAM Surrender Adjustments   &gt; Early Surrender at 8 minutes: Removed (Note: Normal surrender time unchanged.)  Why....? Bring it back"
kj8nuoq,"The Noc Q trail should have been in the game since his release."
kj8rlea,"Finally Nilah getting some love. I can’t count the amount of times I’ve gone in with E&gt;Q&gt;W&gt;AA etc.  only to find myself dying to enemy because W never went off…"
kj9fa63,"&gt; Yorick’s in-games runes will now replace Glacial Augment with First Strike and Aftershock with Grasp of the Undying. This will affect 0.06% of Yorick players.  RIP that one guy in particular"
kj8z9j9,"Wow! Super excited for Smolder!!! I can't WAIT to see what his champ designer comes up with next!!!"
kj8s9yj,"Karthus mid shall be reborn!!!"
kj8jjfd,"Us aram players would like an explanation for WHY 8min surrender was removed. I do not know a single person who thought it was a bad addition???  Some games are lost at &lt;8min  if you play aram enough you know this is just a fact. Also it required 5 people so it didn't even go through most of the time."
kj8zsb1,"&gt;Fixed a bug that caused Master Yi’s Highlander ability to not block the slow effect from Ahri’s charm.    It has been going back and forth for years.    In my opinion  forced movement should have priority over Highlander. It's not a slow  it's "move in specific direction for X seconds".     If you want to keep the movement speed buff  make the units stand still when they're within Ahri's AA range or about to leave Fiddle's Reap range."
kj8vsi9,"- Ctrl + F „Senna“ - no results - still perma banning"
kj9mncq,"What about people below Dia1 with insane negative gains? 2 more losses than wins in G4  never lost at 0LP. Lose - 33 and win +20. Duoq with a plat and we got an Iron 3 with negative winrate and 50+ games into our naked lobby on our team. Can Riot please a least verbally address this  the game doesn't only exist of high elo people and these messed up MMR/LP gains have been posted all over Twitter by many of us low elo people who just constantly get ignored. Even people with positive winrates of 55%+"
kj8r86l,"Removing armor/mr runes is gonna be crazy for a while."
kj8sfya,"Riot  please have some basic proofreading.   Rumble    Q damage **increased**. E magic resist reduction decreased.  Q - Flamespitter    Damage: 135/150/165/180/195 (+110% AP) (+6/7/8/9/10% of target's maximum health) ⇒ 125/140/155/170/185 (+110% AP) (+6/7/8/9/10% of target's maximum health)"
kj8qwhb,"Shaco players finally getting some actual fucking food??  &gt; * Shaco’s clone will now attack the nearest visible enemy champion within 1500 range of it when dead. &gt;  &gt; * Shaco’s clone will now stop to cast the fake W and will only do so within 300 units of Shaco prime. &gt;  &gt; * Shaco clone will stop to cast a fake E and will only do so within 575 units of Shaco prime’s E target  this also fakes a missile. &gt;  &gt; * Shaco clone will properly duplicate energized stacks and effects. &gt;  &gt; * Shaco boxes will proc cosmic drive."
kj9c2gk,"including vanguard is still so baffling  i have faced like single digit scripters in my 10+ years playing  but yeah sure lets monitor our player's pcs 24/7 in case two tits timmy boots up xerathScriptNevaMissSkillShots.exe before their bimonthly TFT game  surely there's a better more ethical solution to this scripter dilemma  solid QoL changes"
kj8qquf,"Akali is pick/ban in pro play  most picked midlaner in Soloq where she has a 50%+ winrate (in the past she was already considered broken by Riot themselves at 46-47%)  How in the world is there no hotfix for this let alone any nerf?"
kj8r88u,"I wish they'd switch tahms adaptive to ap from ad like they did with teemo"
kj8zc7r,"why not just make the support items a one per team buy."
kj95fi8,"How did the Twisted Fate changes make it through? His ad build was already strong  I wouldn't be surprised if these changes are reverted or hotfixed soon after the patch releases."
kj8s0ls,"Oh its the AP briar patch  time for nashors rush into riftmaker should be fun to mess around with some novel builds  No overall lethality nerfs though fucking kill me"
kj8saii,"Actually crazy how LCS will be on a new patch this weekend while everyone else will still be on 14.1."
kj8yefi,"Karma and Gragas back on the flex menu in proplay I imagine.  &gt; newButton added to cycle between various CC Effects on your champion  That's....pretty nice. Lets hope they make it so you can make target dummies throw out whatever ability you want  like crank Q etc. To practice dodges and what not."
kj8yh4s,"No Hubris change on ARAM. Guess AD poke champions once again come out unscathed and lethality ADCs destroying everyone with it."
kj9daq7,"I mean  I suck  but as a Poppy/Sion main  the fuck am I supposed to do about Trundle/Garen/Darius now? These buffs are huge."
kj9afxa,""
